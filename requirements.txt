**Backstage Glamour Website Requirements**

Hi [Client Name]!

I'm excited to build your beauty salon website. To complete the project, I need some information and assets from you. Here's what I need:

**1. About Me Section**
- Content: Please provide the text you'd like to display about yourself/your salon (2-3 paragraphs describing your background, expertise, philosophy, etc.)
- Image: One high-quality portrait photo of yourself (preferably 1000x1000px or larger, professional headshot)

**2. Our Work Section (Portfolio/Before & After)**
Please send images for each service category with the exact service name you'd like displayed. For each image, include:
- High-quality photos (at least 800x600px each)
- Service name to display (e.g., "Classic Lash Extensions", "Brow Lamination & Tint", etc.)
- Please organize by service type and specify which images go with which services

**3. Referral Section**
- Do you want to keep a referral section on the website?
- If yes: What discount percentage should referrers receive? What about referees?
- Any specific terms & conditions for the referral program?

**4. Contact Information**
Please provide:
- Physical location/address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Business hours (including any special holiday hours)

**5. Appointment Booking Form**
Currently I'm collecting: Name, Email, Phone, Service selection, and Comments.

Questions:
- Do you want to add any other fields (like preferred date/time, allergies, etc.)?
- Do you want to show available time slots on the website and link it to Google Calendar for automatic scheduling?
- If yes for Google Calendar integration, what email address do you currently use for Backstage Glamour bookings?

**6. Customer Feedback Section**
- Do you want to add an automated feedback system where:
  - I send a feedback request email to clients after their appointment
  - Display positive reviews/testimonials on the website automatically
- If yes, I'll need access to send emails from your business email

**Timeline & Next Steps**
Once I receive these materials, I can complete the website within 3-5 business days. Please send everything in one email or shared folder for easy access.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
